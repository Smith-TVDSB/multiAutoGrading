# ICS3U-2.0.1-Autograde
Used to autograde return functions exercise in C++  

## Don't edit  
Don't edit any files except the student.hpp I will know and your score will result in a 0. If there's an issue with one of the tests let me know.
  
## Once Complete:  
Copy your function code from your program into the student.hpp file. Be sure not to change the name of the functions or the autograding will not work. once the code is pasted in make sure you match up the arguement names.   
  
## Check work:  
You can check your work by going to the "Actions" tab, this will show you if you completed all the tests and tell you if there's a test case that didn't work. If all is done correctly then you will see a big green checkmark.
